Welcome Soldier, you have been selected to be apart of Task Force Nu-7. You take orders from 05-3 and your Captain. Your main goal is to deal with intruders and rouge CD. In the case of a breach you will hunt down whomever has breached the scp and deal with them. If you fail to find them you will report that to IA and help recontain the breached SCP. You will roam the facility and make sure no danger is within. In the case of a riot you will strictly guard CDC while also checking for any CD who have successfully escaped.

You have now completed training.
Good luck soldier.
Signed, Officer **[REDACTED]** | Task Force Null-Nil.
