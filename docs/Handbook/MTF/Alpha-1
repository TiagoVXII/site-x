Welcome  Soldier, you have made it to one of the best task forces within **[REDACTED]**. 05-3,05-1 and 05-X are the only people you take direct orders from. You are here to protect the VIPS. Unless 05-X asks you to disband, if the VIP requests you to disband you will refuse and one of you (the lowest ranking member) will stay to protect the VIP. Besides protecting VIPS you will terminate any Chaos Insurgency and Class-D outside of their Cells (unless they are accompanied by a Foundation Researcher and a Member of the Security Department. If Task Force X, IA, VIPS request assistance with a situation, you are to respond immediately, even if you are guarding an 05 (this rules excludes 05-X, 05-1 and 05-3 you will first ask them to be excused and will then move to the emergency.)

You have now completed training.
Good luck soldier.
Signed, Officer **[REDACTED]** | Task Force Null-Nil.
