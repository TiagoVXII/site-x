Welcome Soldier, you have been selected to be a part of reinforcement unit Psi-9. You are the sole explorers of SCP-002. Your main goals are to reinforce any unit requesting assistance and terminate any foundation personnel that violates the Code of Ethics (CoE). IA will report to you in case any foundation personnel violates the CoE. In case of a reinforcement request you will respond, unless a specific task force is requested. When exploring 002 you will be supervised by an 05 and Foundation Researcher.

You have now completed training.
Good luck soldier.
Signed, Officer **[REDACTED]** | Task Force Null-Nil.
