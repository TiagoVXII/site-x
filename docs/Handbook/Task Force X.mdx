You take no orders from anyone except from him. Use your common sense and consider suggestions from IA and other 05s. You are not here to guard anyone unless you have been asked to by the 05-X. You are here to get a hold of situations quickly with the help of the Intelligence Agency. With that information you will move to the breached SCP or Chaos Insurgency infiltration as soon as possible. Your job is not to guard CDC and you will also not chase a Class D that is not a direct threat to you or the VIPS. In the case of a Nuke you will guard the Bunker under any circumstances.
