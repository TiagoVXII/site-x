Welcome Operative, you have officially been made a part of SSR (Special Security Response Unit). You take orders from any higher ranking members in the foundation (For example; any MTF unit, IA, ADâ€¦.) thus if requested you will escort/support them. Your main goal is to terminate any rogue CD, you roam the facility to check for CDs and chase them down. Your exoskeleton suit should assist you in most actions. Tests have proven that your exoskeleton is capable of making you 10-15% faster.

You have now completed training.
Good luck Operative.
Signed, Officer **[REDACTED]** | Task Force Null-Nil.
